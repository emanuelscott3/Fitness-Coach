I am interested in keeping track of my fitness goals. This app will allow users to track their macros, daily workouts, water consumption and meal plans tailored to them. To figure out a weight lift phase user will be able to choose which weight training option is best for them. Here are the categories: Muscle strength, Increased Muscle Size, Maintain and HITT training. 

The user will also have to use a weight scale and take pictures through the app of their body to get the most accurate results. The users will have access to see how they are progressing by looking at the graphs that will show overall progression:

* Weight 
* Body fat percentage
* Waist measuremeant
* Progress Pictures
* Food consumption 

1. All can be tracked:
 * Daily 
 * Weekly 
 * Monthly
 * Yearly  

All this can be done on the users’ phone.

 

Fitness is about measurable results by having this type of application all users can see how they are progressing in their fitness goals whiling recording their journey. This app will allow users to feel satisfaction as they see the changes in the app of their progress.

 

Users can scan food items with their phones, in the app it will store the food item and the macro nutritional facts. It will also have suggestions of other foods that match the macros for the user’s current food items. The app will show the current price of the food items as well as if there are any other cheaper items available.

 

The app will have daily reminders, upcoming meals and workouts. The user will receive alerts on monthly, quarterly and yearly achievements badges. The alert will notify the user they have burned 10,000 calories this month. The user will also have a reminder alerting them to burn more the following month or to try setting a higher goal since they are killing the workouts.  The best feature of the app will be the ability to connect to a live personal trainer and to request for customizable meals for the user
